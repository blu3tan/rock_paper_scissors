- Rock Paper Scissors -

Coded complete javascript game playable from the console.

---------------------------------------------

Notes:
It was brutal... but i enjoyed every minute.

Notes expanded:
I was glad to skip the "blank page" crisis, thanks to the prblem solving plan part of the course (golden!).

Coded all the single parts, tested one by one, all working fine.

Later realised the pieces didn't fit togheter to accomplish a full working program (despair).

Corrected the code after extensive searches online, implemented the solutions only after studying why it worked and how... It wasn't feel right tho.

Made a new script.js and started from scratch, only using concepts covered on the course, except for some loops, and succeded (triumph!).
