ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

Ok i've probably spent to much time on polishing this, but i had an idea and
i wanted to achieve the exact look i had in mind.
I've learnd a lot in the process and i am quite proud of the final result.

One of my first goal for the graphical side was to provide with the game an
original user experience but at the same time keeping it simple.
I have used a custom svg with an attached image and the buttons mapped on top
as vector shapes so the project is fully responsive.

CREDITS:

-   The computer is an Amdek 310-A (modified) inspired by LGR

-   The retro sound effects are from https://pixabay.com/

-   The ascii emoji are from https://github.com/dysfunc/ascii-emoji

I have hidden (not quite) the credits inside the design as an easter egg.
I also left at the bottom of this readme the old notes written on the first
stage of this project.

Enjoy.

OLD NOTES FROM FIRST ASSIGNEMENT OF THE EXERCISE

Coded complete javascript game playable from the console.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
It was brutal... but i enjoyed every minute.

Notes expanded:
I was glad to skip the "blank page" crisis, thanks to the prblem solving plan part of the course (golden!).

Coded all the single parts, tested one by one, all working fine.

Later realised the pieces didn't fit togheter to accomplish a full working program (despair).

Corrected the code after extensive searches online, implemented the solutions only after studying why it worked and how... It wasn't feel right tho.

Made a new script.js and started from scratch, only using concepts covered on the course, except for some loops, and succeded (triumph!).
